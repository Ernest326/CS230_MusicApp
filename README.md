# Music App
This project is a simple React full-stack application made as an assignment as a part of my coursework  
The goal is to make an app similar to Spotify which allows to list songs, artists etc. that are fetched from a database

**Technologies Used:**  
I am using a monorepo strucutre for the frontend and backend and using lerna for monorepo management  
For styling I decided to go with mui  
I am using an SQL database provided by the college for storing data  
For requests im using Axios and Express.js
